I have embarked on a journey of studying system design, and I figured that one of the more essential activities in system design is creating diagrams.

Creating diagrams reminds me of UML. I tried to learn UML a decade ago, but because I have not put into constant use what I learned, it has faded into oblivion.*

But now that I have the need to create diagrams, I have to relearn UML. Along with it, I need to familiarize myself with this newer diagramming approach called [The C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) which I encountered while exploring the GitHub repository ["Modular Monolith with DDD"](https://github.com/kgrzybek/modular-monolith-with-ddd). 

Based on my own experience and the experiences of others, a good thing to do when learning something is to copy the masters. So that's what I will do with regards to diagramming --- imitate the C4 and UML diagrams made by the masters. I'll be posting in this blog the resulting works.
